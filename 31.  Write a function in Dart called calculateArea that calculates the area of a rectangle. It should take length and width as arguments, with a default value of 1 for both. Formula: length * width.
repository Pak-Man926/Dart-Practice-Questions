//Write a function in Dart called calculateArea that calculates the area of a rectangle. It should take length and width as arguments, with a default value of 1 for both. Formula: length * width.

void main()
{
  calculateArea(10,15);
}
void calculateArea(var length, var width)
{
  length = length + 1;
  
  width = width + 1;
  
  var area = length * width;
  
  print("Area the rectangle of width: $width and length: $length is : $area");
}
